  <a href=images/cherub.png target=_blank><img src=thumbs/cherub.png></a><br><em>the cherub</em> - a hypothetical proposal for inclusion in the emoji keyboard. cupid, commonly known as the cherub with a bow and arrow, is a well-known symbol in our pop culture. cupid's demeanor is usually portrayed as mischeivous or playful and we often refer to being "struck by cupid's arrow" to express sentiments of love or infatuation. i felt this addition would make for a lighthearted and whimsical reference to love and relationships. <a href=https://mymodernmet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cupid-painting-8.jpg target=_blank>original art</a> was vectorized using adobe illustrator and photoshop.<br><br><br><br><br>
  <a href=images/soulsucker.png target=_blank><img src=thumbs/soulsucker.png></a><br><em>soul sucker</em> - this project asked us to glitch an image that represents our relationship with social media and the internet. i chose a shower drain because of the amount of time, attention, amd energy that social media takes from my daily life. the process of glitching involved a re-evaluation of this relationship and shed light on aspects of social media that i tend to take for granted. mostly being the vast potential for connection. original photo was glitched using audacity.<br><br><br><br><br>
  <a href=images/comp.png target=_blank><img src=thumbs/comp.png></a><br><em>power</em> - a composite piece created meant to emphasize contrast between nature and modern city setting. my group's intention was to create a hyper-realistic setting while also exploring the kingdoms of life. the kingdom i used was animalia. i wanted to create a conversation about how invasive our human nature is by referencing de-forestation, extinction and overall endangered life with the use of animals. this image was created using adobe photoshop.<br><br><br><br><br>
  <a href=https://vimeo.com/363399276 target=_blank><img src=thumbs/vid.png></a><br><em>$ummer</em> - a collage of videos of experiences i have had with or in nature and its elements to the sound of me depositing money into an atm. an under-developed commentary on capitalism and how even experiences in nature have been monetized. video was put together with adobe premiere.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
  <a href=https://oscareduardodelgadillo.github.io/netart74 target=_blank><img src=thumbs/mysp1.png></a><br><em>myspace memories</em> - my project partner and i designed this website to reference our earliest memories of the internet. we wanted to generate nostalgia by re-creating a myspace layout and re-visiting our primary interests at the time - mostly being music, fashion, and social connection. html code written on atom.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
  <a href=https://editor.p5js.org/loxhmi/present/nQKWXl-wG target=_blank><img src=thumbs/p5prac.png></a><br><em>p5 practice</em> - an in-class exercise that asked us to create a robot using the <a href=https://editor.p5js.org/ target=_blank>p5js editor</a>.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
  <a href=https://loxhmi.github.io/p5-art/ target=_blank><img src=thumbs/codeart.png></a><br><em>we are all made of stars</em> - an interactive code art piece in which you can click and drag your mouse to create constellations amongst the stars. similar to a buddha-board or a mandala drawn in sand, the constellations are only temporary and fade away with time, reflecting on the impermenance of all things in this life. the eyeball following the cursor is another subtle reminder that all that goes on in this vast universe is being observed and ingested by an omnipresent collctive unconscious that unites all intergalactic creators. this piece was made using p5js.<br><br><br><br>
  <a href=https://loxhmi.github.io/final/ target=_blank><img src=thumbs/shaman.png></a><br><em>the shaman</em> - a composite piece using photos of various entheogenic and psychoactive plants. meant to feel almost as if you are in the presence of a fortune teller, the floating text clouds tell of metaphysical truths gathered from research and exploration of shamanism.
