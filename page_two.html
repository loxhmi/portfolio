      <h1>ARTIST'S STATEMENT</h1><strong><br>
<p>Jessica Smith - As a painter, I primarily work in acrylic and my style is considered <br>"art-deco." This art 74 class has been my first formal introduction to digital media. My work has primarily drawn <br>from two inspirations, one being my love and reverence for nature.  I like to create direct contrast with natural <br>elements to emphasize how far-removed from nature we have become.  Another inspiration for me is my reflections on <br>society and social dynamism.  I am really interested in how people have developed our society into what it <br>currently through their own personal and individual attitudes and behaviors. Using computers and computer systems as <br>a medium for art has begun a paradigm shift for me and my relationship with art as well as my own personal and <br>professional artistic expression.</p>
