      <h1>ARTIST'S STATEMENT</h1><strong><br>
<p>I am a visual artist based in East Bay, CA.  I primarily work in acrylic paint and my style is considered <br>"art-deco." This art 74 class has been my first formal introduction to digital media. My work has primarily drawn <br>from two inspirations, one being my love and reverence for nature.  I like to create direct contrast with natural <br>elements to emphasize how far-removed from nature human beings have become.  Another inspiration for me is my reflections on <br>society and social dynamism.  I am really interested in how people have developed our society into what it is<br>currently through our collective and individual attitudes and behaviors. Using computers and computer systems as <br>a medium for art has been an extremely rewarding challenge and has had a big impact on my personal as well as <br>professional artistic process and expression.</p>
